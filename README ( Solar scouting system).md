Hello world!!!

This is a 'README' file for the 'Solar scouting system'.

The real project name is 'Solar Scouting System with Raspberry Pi Pico W'.


This project is used to find the best spot to harvest solar energy to power electronic devices especially electronic cars with the Raspberry Pi Pico W.



The real problem we are trying to solve is the emmissions of carbon into the atmosphere especially in the car industry, and the problem this project is solving is the slow charging of electronic vehicles due to the low amount of sunight shinnig at the charging station.



The materials needed are:
1. Raspberry Pi Pico W:  The main microcontroller for measuring voltage.
2. Solar Panels: To generate electricity from sunlight.
3. Voltage Divider Components:
   - Resistors: To create a voltage divider circuit.
   - Breadboard: For prototyping and connecting components.
   - Jumper Wires: To connect the circuit components.
4. LCD Screen: Optional for displaying voltage readings.
5. Power Source: To power the Raspberry Pi Pico W.
6. Computer: For programming the Raspberry Pi Pico W.
7

7. Micro USB Cable: To connect the Raspberry Pi Pico W to the computer for programming and power.
